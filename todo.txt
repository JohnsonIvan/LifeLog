* Flask's "instance" folder should absolutely not be in the code folder. Because
  A: that makes no sense at all, and B: it complicates the deploy script.

* Learn about these packages; they seem like they would enable me to cleanup my
  code a bit. All are available in Arch repos

  * python-flask-migrate
  * marshmallow / flask-marshmallow
  * sqlalchemy / flask-sqlalchemy

* Two Generals Problem

  Client generates a UUID for each request. If server does not ack the
  request, the request is resent several times with the same UUID until the
  server does ack it. The server has a "Request" database, which stores the
  UUID, response code/headers, and a response BLOB (actually, just filename?
  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯). NULL value means the request is still processing.

  This is not necessary for endpoints that don't modify the server's state?
  (including all GET requests)

  On client side, if server isn't responding ping OVH & google to test internet
  connection. That way error messages can be more confident about whether or not
  it's the client's fault.

  I'll probably do this with a python decorator, but I should still investigate
  the fact that flask might have a way of registering a function as a
  preprocessor of sorts. Unless flask's way is unexpectedly awesome, I'd prefer
  an explicit decorator over an implicit one.

* Eventually, want a table describing what timezone the user is in
  (UID, timezone name, timezone offset from UTC, UTC time at which the user
  started living here).

  to the user's timezone at a particular time:
  SELECT *, MAX(start) FROM utcOffset WHERE start <= $(arg1)

  All times in database are stored as UTC; if necessary convert to my then-local
  timezone using the table.

  probs easiest to just have an additional entry here for each time that DST
  changes

* deadman's switch. If more than n days pass without any changes, send a payload
  over email. Optionally send a warning payload sooner.
