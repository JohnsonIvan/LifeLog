Development process:

  * ./Server/local.bash: launches a simple server using the checked out code;
    used to test web apis

  * ./Server/deploy.bash: copies the checked out code to server directories &
    sets up systemd to launch them automatically

* Start with tracking weight, that's trivial by comparison.

* Two Generals Problem

  Client generates a UUID for each request. If server does not ack the
  request, the request is resent several times with the same UUID until the
  server does ack it. The server has a "Request" database, which stores the
  UUID, response code/headers, and a response BLOB (actually, just filename?
  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯). NULL value means the request is still processing. Probs want a
  @Request annotation that handles all of this (& authentication).

  On client side, if server isn't responding ping OVH & google to test internet
  connection. That way error messages can be more confident about whether or not
  it's the client's fault.

* Eventually, want a table describing what timezone the user is in
  (UID, timezone name, timezone offset from UTC, UTC time at which the user
  started living here).

  to the user's timezone at a particular time:
  SELECT *, MAX(start) FROM utcOffset WHERE start <= $(arg1)

  All times in database are stored as UTC; if necessary convert to my then-local
  timezone using the table.

  probs easiest to just have an additional entry here for each time that DST
  changes
